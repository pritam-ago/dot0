# Local development environment variables
# The web client now directly connects to the deployed relay server

# Note: The web client is configured to always connect to the deployed relay server
# at dot0-go-relay.onrender.com using WSS protocol. No environment variables
# are needed for the connection URL as it's hardcoded in the application.

# For local development, you can still use these if needed for testing:
# REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_HOST=localhost
# REACT_APP_WEBSOCKET_PORT=8080
