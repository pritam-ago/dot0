# Production environment variables for web-client
# The web client now directly connects to the deployed relay server

# Note: The web client is configured to always connect to the deployed relay server
# at dot0-go-relay.onrender.com using WSS protocol. No environment variables
# are needed for the connection URL as it's hardcoded in the application.

# If you need to override the relay server URL in production, you can set:
# REACT_APP_RELAY_HOST=your-custom-relay-server.com
